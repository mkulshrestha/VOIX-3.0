# VOIX-3.0
this is the latest version of my application named VOIX which is a voice command. it provides user with the ability to 
navigate through applications on their android devices by simply calling out the custom commands set by them or by the 
app names. this application was first published on google appstore in the late 2015. after that it was taken down by 
the google after they changed some permission setting. then the second version of this app was again published 
after satisfying the new requirements set by GOOGLE. Now since the apk signature of the app has been lost due to the change
in machine used to develop the application originally, the app is not currently on the google playstore.
